# Taylor Series Exploration
## Overview
This project delves into the mathematical concept of Taylor Series, an infinite sum of terms expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. Aimed at explaining and visualizing how Taylor Series can approximate functions, this exploration covers the fundamentals of function approximations, higher order derivatives, polynomial approximations of real functions, and Euler's formula, along with the Taylor Inequality.

## Introduction
Taylor Series play a crucial role in mathematical analysis and computational applications. They allow us to approximate complex functions with polynomials that are much simpler to analyze and compute. This project aims to demystify Taylor Series by breaking down their purpose, derivation, and practical applications, especially in function approximation.

## Features
- Detailed explanation of Taylor Series and their significance in mathematics.
- Exploration of higher order derivatives and polynomial approximations.
- Visual representations of function approximations using Taylor Series.
- Examination of Euler's formula in the context of Taylor Series.
- Discussion of the Taylor Inequality and its implications.
